======

* [2020/08/07] files submitted to srcpaths do not work 
  (either fix, or disallow)

* [2020/08/07] verify and warn if the same disk is mounted
  on disk rollover

* [2020/08/07] code and tests are really horrible. maybe rewrite?

* [2020/08/07] rewrite as queue/consumer so faster (accept num workers on cli)
